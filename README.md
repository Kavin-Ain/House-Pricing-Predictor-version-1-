# House_Pricing_Predictor_v1
This simple linear regression model demonstrates the use of scikit-learn to predict house prices based on the size of the house. This is done by using a simple CSV dataset sourced from Zillow,  containing the house's size in square footage and its corresponding prices in millions of dollars.

# Features
- Splits the data into training and test sets (80/20 ratio)
- Trains a linear regression model using scikit-learn
- Predicts house prices from the test set
- Visualizes actual vs. predicted prices using matplotlib
  - **Blue dots**: Actual house prices from the test data
  - **Red line**: Predicted prices from the linear regression model


  # Dependencies

  Install the following libraries using pip:

  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
